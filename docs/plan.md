Phase 1: Build the Core Technology

    Define the scope:
        Focus on invoice and receipt processing initially
        Extract key fields: dates, amounts, vendor info, item descriptions, totals

    Technical implementation:

    # Core processing pipeline using free/open-source tools
    import pytesseract
    from transformers import pipeline
    from PIL import Image
    import re

    def process_document(image_path):
        # Extract text using OCR
        img = Image.open(image_path)
        raw_text = pytesseract.image_to_string(img)
        
        # Use NER to identify entities
        ner = pipeline("ner")
        entities = ner(raw_text)
        
        # Extract structured data using regex and NLP
        result = {
            "date": extract_date(raw_text),
            "total_amount": extract_amount(raw_text),
            "vendor": extract_vendor(raw_text, entities),
            "items": extract_line_items(raw_text)
        }
        
        return result

    Build a simple web interface:
        Upload area for documents
        Results display with extracted information
        Option to correct errors and provide feedback (crucial for improving the model)

Phase 2: Create a Minimum Viable Product

    Add essential features:
        User accounts
        Document history
        Export to CSV/Excel
        Simple dashboard showing processing statistics

    Implement your free tier limitations:
        Document count tracking
        Clear upgrade paths

    Deploy on your existing Vercel setup
        Connect to a free tier database like MongoDB Atlas or Supabase

Phase 3: Testing and Refinement

    Self-testing:
        Process 20-30 different invoices and receipts
        Identify and fix common extraction errors
        Optimize for different document formats

    Beta testing:
        Find 3-5 friends or connections who deal with invoices
        Offer free processing in exchange for feedback
        Use their feedback to improve accuracy and usability

Phase 4: Prepare for Outreach

    Create demonstration materials:
        Short video showing the process and time saved
        Before/after comparison of manual vs. automated processing
        ROI calculator ("Save X hours per month worth $Y")

    Develop a clear onboarding process:
        Welcome email sequence
        Quick-start guide
        FAQ document addressing common concerns

    Set up payment processing:
        Use Stripe or PayPal for subscription billing
        Implement secure payment flow
