Phase 1: Build the Core Technology

    Define the scope:
        Focus on invoice and receipt processing initially
        Extract key fields: dates, amounts, vendor info, item descriptions, totals

    Technical implementation:

    # Core processing pipeline using free/open-source tools
    from donut_pipeline import run_donut
from layoutlm_pipeline import extract_entities
from feedback_loop import save_user_feedback

def process_document(image_path):
    raw_text, layout = run_donut(image_path)  # OCR + layout

    fields = extract_entities(raw_text, layout)
    # fields = { 'date': ..., 'vendor': ..., 'amount': ..., 'items': [...] }

    return fields


    Build a simple web interface:
        Upload area for documents
        Results display with extracted information
        Option to correct errors and provide feedback (crucial for improving the model)

Phase 2: Create a Minimum Viable Product

    Add essential features:
        User accounts
        Document history
        Export to CSV/Excel
        Simple dashboard showing processing statistics

    Implement your free tier limitations:
        Document count tracking
        Clear upgrade paths

    Deploy on your existing Vercel setup
        Connect to a free tier database like MongoDB Atlas or Supabase

Phase 3: Testing and Refinement

    Self-testing:
        Process 20-30 different invoices and receipts
        Identify and fix common extraction errors
        Optimize for different document formats

    Beta testing:
        Find 3-5 friends or connections who deal with invoices
        Offer free processing in exchange for feedback
        Use their feedback to improve accuracy and usability

Phase 4: Prepare for Outreach

    Create demonstration materials:
        Short video showing the process and time saved
        Before/after comparison of manual vs. automated processing
        ROI calculator ("Save X hours per month worth $Y")

    Develop a clear onboarding process:
        Welcome email sequence
        Quick-start guide
        FAQ document addressing common concerns

    Set up payment processing:
        Use Stripe or PayPal for subscription billing
        Implement secure payment flow


Improve vendor/date/amount extraction (regex + structure)
Use LayoutLM (better NER, but still free via Hugging Face)
Add user login/signup (Flask-Login, free)
Add dashboard to view processed docs
Deploy to free hosting (Render/Fly.io)

PART 2: Turn It Into a SaaS
Once your extraction is better, let‚Äôs make this a sellable SaaS app.

 1. Add User Accounts
Use Flask-Login or Auth0
Each user can:
Upload documents
View past uploads
Manage billing (Stripe)
2. Add Billing (Stripe)
Free tier: 5 docs/month
Basic: $49/mo
Premium: $199/mo
Use Stripe Checkout or Billing
3. Store Processed Results
Use SQLite or PostgreSQL
Save:
File metadata
Extracted fields
User ID
Timestamp
4. Dashboard UI
Show upload history
Export as CSV/Excel
Allow corrections / edits
5. Deploy to Production
Use one of these:

Render.com (easiest)
Fly.io
DigitalOcean App Platform
Docker + VPS
