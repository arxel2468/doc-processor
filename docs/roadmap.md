âœ… 3. DEVELOPMENT PLAN
Phase 1: MVP (Local Development)
 Build document processor (âœ… Done!)
 Add Flask API (/upload, returns JSON)
 Add simple dashboard: upload â†’ view results
 Save parsed data locally (JSON or SQLite)
 Add basic file validation
Phase 2: User Accounts
 Add registration/login with Flask-Login or Supabase Auth
 Associate uploaded docs with users
 Show upload history per user
Phase 3: API Access
 Create /api/upload secured with API key
 Rate-limit by user/API key (Flask-Limiter)
Phase 4: Hosting
 Deploy backend to Render or Fly.io
 Deploy frontend to Vercel
 Use Supabase for DB & Auth (optional, free)
âœ… 4. MONETIZATION PLAN (NO COST)
ðŸ”„ Freemium Model
Free plan: limited uploads per month (e.g. 20)
Paid: higher limits, API access, history, export, etc.
Use Stripe or Lemon Squeezy for payments (both have free tiers)
ðŸ§  Value-Added Features (Premium)
CSV or Excel export
Email-to-parse (forward invoices to an email)
API integration with QuickBooks, Notion, Airtable
Template training (custom fine-tuning)
âœ… 5. MARKETING (FREE)
Build in public on Twitter/X, LinkedIn
Submit to:
Product Hunt
BetaList
Hacker News / IndieHackers
Create a landing page (free with Vercel + Next.js or Carrd)
âœ… 6. SECURITY & SCALING
Concern	Solution
File uploads	Validate, limit size, scan MIME type
User data	Isolate per-user with auth
Model scaling	Run locally for now, later use HuggingFace Inference API (has free tier)
Abuse (API)	Rate-limit & API keys
âœ… 7. BONUS: Open Source Strategy (Optional)
Make your core processor open source on GitHub
Drive interest, grow trust
Keep SaaS version with premium features
