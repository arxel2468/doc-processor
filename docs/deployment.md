Putting this into production means making it:

âœ… Reliable
âœ… Scalable
âœ… Maintainable
âœ… Secure
âœ… Easy to run/deploy
ðŸš€ TL;DR â€“ What You Need to Go to Production
Hereâ€™s what you need to do step-by-step:

âœ… 1. Package Your App Properly
Your app has:

Flask backend (routes.py)
processor.py that loads and runs the Donut model
Frontend (HTML + JS)
Dependencies like transformers, torch, opencv, etc.
âž¤ Do this:
Create a requirements.txt file:

pip freeze > requirements.txt
Add a run.py file if you donâ€™t have one:

from app import create_app  # assuming you have an app factory
app = create_app()

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=5000)  # change to 0.0.0.0 for external access
âœ… 2. Use a Production Web Server
Flaskâ€™s built-in server is for development only. Use Gunicorn or Uvicorn with FastAPI or Flask.

âž¤ Install Gunicorn:

pip install gunicorn
âž¤ Run your app:

gunicorn --bind 0.0.0.0:5000 run:app
âœ… 3. Containerize with Docker (Highly Recommended)
This solves all "it works on my machine" issues.

âž¤ Create a Dockerfile:

# Use official Python image
FROM python:3.10-slim

# Set working directory
WORKDIR /app

# Copy files
COPY . .

# Install dependencies
RUN pip install --upgrade pip
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt

# Expose port
EXPOSE 5000

# Run app with gunicorn
CMD ["gunicorn", "--bind", "0.0.0.0:5000", "run:app"]
âž¤ Build and run:

docker build -t doc-processor .
docker run -p 5000:5000 doc-processor
âœ… 4. Handle the Model Download
Right now, you're using:


pip install git+https://github.com/clovaai/donut
This installs everything and downloads model weights from Hugging Face.

For production, you should:

Pre-download the model
Or cache it in Docker during build
âž¤ Option A: Pre-download and use local_files_only=True

from transformers import DonutProcessor, VisionEncoderDecoderModel

processor = DonutProcessor.from_pretrained('./models/donut')
model = VisionEncoderDecoderModel.from_pretrained('./models/donut').to(device)
Then, in your Dockerfile:


COPY ./models/donut /app/models/donut
âœ… 5. Use a GPU in Production (Optional but Ideal)
Donut is a large model and runs much faster on a GPU.

âž¤ If you're deploying on cloud (see hosting below), use a GPU instance:
AWS EC2 (with NVIDIA)
Google Cloud (AI Platform, or Compute Engine with GPU)
Azure ML
RunPod or Modal (cheap options for GPU inference)
Hugging Face Inference Endpoints (you can even serve your own Donut model from there)
âœ… 6. Choose a Hosting Platform
Here are your options:

Option	Best For	Notes
Render.com	Simplicity	Free tier, auto deploy from GitHub
Railway.app	Fast deployment	Free for small apps
Heroku	General apps	No GPU
AWS EC2	Power + GPU	More setup work
RunPod.io	Cheap GPU	Good for hosted inference
Hugging Face Spaces	Demo-only	If you want a public UI
Docker on VPS	Full control	Use DigitalOcean, Linode, etc.
âœ… 7. Add Monitoring and Logging
Important for production!

Use logging instead of print
Log errors to a file or service (like Sentry)
Monitor GPU/CPU usage
âœ… 8. Security & Maintenance
âœ… Limit file size / type on upload
âœ… Sanitize filenames
âœ… Set a timeout for model inference
âœ… Add HTTPS (if needed)
âœ… Keep dependencies updated
âœ… 9. Optional: Use FastAPI Instead of Flask
Flask is fine, but FastAPI is:

Faster
Async
Easier to deploy with uvicorn
Great with Pydantic for validation
âœ… 10. (Optional) Add Frontend Hosting
If your frontend gets bigger, you may want to:

Build it with React/Vue
Serve it from Netlify or Vercel
Make it talk to your Flask/FastAPI backend via REST API
âœ… Summary â€“ Production Deployment Checklist
Step	Task
âœ… Package	requirements.txt, run.py
âœ… Production server	Use Gunicorn or Uvicorn
âœ… Dockerize	Build with model + app
âœ… Cloud hosting	Use Render, Railway, AWS, etc.
âœ… GPU	Use if needed for speed
âœ… Model caching	Avoid downloading model at runtime
âœ… File validation	Secure uploads
âœ… Monitoring	Logs, errors, health checks
âœ… Want the Fastest Path?
If you want zero-hassle deployment, Iâ€™d recommend:

âž¤ Use Render.com with Docker
Free tier
Auto-deploy from GitHub
Just push your code
âž¤ Or use RunPod.io if you want GPU
Cheap GPU inference
Run Flask/FastAPI with model
Expose via HTTP
